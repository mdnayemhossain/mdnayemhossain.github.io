                        <p>Welcome to my portfolio website. I, Mohammad Nayem Hossain, am a graduate student in Electronics at the <a href="https://www.oulu.fi/en/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">University of Oulu</a>, currently residing in Oulu, Finland. Previously, I worked as an Analog Layout Design Engineer at the Dhaka office of <a href="https://www.quest-global.com/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Quest Global</a> in Bangladesh. Before that, I served as an Assistant Engineer in the IC Mask Design Department at <a href="https://www.ulkasemi.com/bangladesh/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Ulkasemi</a>, also located in Bangladesh. Prior to entering the industry, I had the opportunity to work as a research student in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nsuopticslab/home" target="_blank" style="color: black;">NSU Optics Lab</a>, part of the <a href="http://ece.northsouth.edu" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Electrical and Computer Engineering Department</a> at <a href="http://www.northsouth.edu" target="_blank" style="color: black;">North South University (NSU)</a>.</p>
                        <p>I have achieved a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from NSU with a commendable academic record. Throughout my time at the university, I was granted a merit-based tuition waiver from the second semester until my graduation for my good academic performance. Additionally, I ranked among the top 10% of graduates in the 'Graduating Class of 2019,' which comprised 3470 graduates. Before, I completed my Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examination from <a href="https://dhakacollege.edu.bd/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Dhaka College</a> and Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination from <a href="http://www.nzs.edu.bd/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Noakhali Zilla School</a>.</p>
                        <p>I am captivated by the limitless potential of VLSI technology and the prospect of applying innovative problem-solving to push the boundaries of electronic design. With the limitations of Moore's law in mind, I am intrigued by the possibilities of quantum computing and photonics to solve complex issues in the lowest amount of time. My journey in research began with an exploration of electromagnetics and optical physics, which helped me better to understand the behavior of light on nanoscale-level objects. This piqued my interest in quantum computing and photonics, driving me to delve deeper into research methodologies and explore novel solutions to complex challenges. My experience in the VLSI industry has given me a deeper understanding of solid-state electronic devices and their limitations which excited me about pursuing groundbreaking research in this field.</p>
                        <p>Besides my undergraduate studies, I was involved with several organizations, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ieeensu-ras/about/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">IEEE NSU Robotics and Automation Society</a>, <a href="https://jaago.com.bd" target="_blank" style="color: black;">JAAGO Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://vbd.com.bd" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Volunteer for Bangladesh (VBD)</a>. In 2014, I began volunteering at VBD, Dhaka division, which is a non-political youth wing of JAAGO. Through my involvement with multiple organizations and volunteering in various social communities, my social and interpersonal abilities have improved significantly.</p>
                        <p>I am a somewhat introverted individual who enjoys reading books from various genres, including thriller, mystery, fantasy, science fiction, and classic literature. I strive to maintain a sense of contentment while continuously challenging myself to evolve and improve in preparation for what lies ahead. Because I always remember the following quote by Carl Sagan,</p>
                        <q>Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.</q>

                                        <p>This paper delves into the phenomenon of trapping force exerted on chiral particles when subjected to a field comprising two counter-propagating plane waves with orthogonal polarization. In addition, the paper aims to elucidate the fundamental physics behind this phenomenon by modeling the particle as a chiral dipole and conducting an analytical study of the optical force. The research results show that the trapping force is strongly correlated with the dual "electric-magnetic" symmetry of the field and the dual asymmetry of the material. Moreover, the proposed technique is not restricted to dipolar chiral objects alone; chiral Mie objects can also be trapped using this method. The chiral trapping force has the potential for various applications, such as identifying the chirality of objects and selectively trapping chiral objects. In summary, the paper provides a thorough analysis of the trapping force on chiral particles and offers valuable insights into the underlying physics of this phenomenon.</p>
