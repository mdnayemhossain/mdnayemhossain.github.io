                        <p>I, Mohammad Nayem Hossain, presently working as an analog design engineer at the Dhaka office of <a href="https://www.synapse-da.com/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Synapse Design</a> in Bangladesh. Prior to this, I served as an assistant engineer in the IC Mask Design Department at <a href="https://www.ulkasemi.com/bangladesh/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Ulkasemi</a>, also located in Bangladesh. Before entering the industry, I had the chance to work as a research student in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nsuopticslab/home" target="_blank" style="color: black;">NSU Optics Lab</a>, which is a part of the <a href="http://ece.northsouth.edu" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Electrical and Computer Engineering Department</a> of <a href="http://www.northsouth.edu" target="_blank" style="color: black;">North South University (NSU)</a>.</p>
                        <p>I have achieved a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from NSU with a commendable academic record. Throughout my time at the university, I was granted a merit-based tuition waiver from the second semester until my graduation for my good academic performance. Additionally, I ranked among the top 10% of graduates in the 'Graduating Class of 2019,' which comprised 3470 graduates. Before, I completed my Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examination from <a href="https://dhakacollege.edu.bd/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Dhaka College</a> and Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination from <a href="http://www.nzs.edu.bd/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Noakhali Zilla School</a>.</p>
                        <p>I am interested in Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science, particularly devising a better problem-solving method for intricate tasks. Indeed, it is superfluous to say that data is an essential part of our daily lives in the data-driven era. With that, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as one of the most crucial components to keep pace with the current world. Humongous data is generated every second, and deriving meaning from this ocean of data fascinates me. Due to the growing passion for ML, Data Science, and research, I started my research journey in the biomedical field on '<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/IS.2018.8710490" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Glaucoma (group of eye conditions) detection</a>' using Fuzzy Logic. Later, during the ML course, I had the opportunity to work on '<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sujitdebnath/sujitdebnath.github.io/master/src/resources/cse445_stroke_risk_prediction_report.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Early Risk Prediction of Stroke</a>,' where we used various ML algorithms to predict stroke risk. These research works helped me to explore research methodologies more closely and encouraged me to engage deeply in research. Afterward, as my undergraduate thesis, I wanted to explore another prominent domain of ML- Natural Language Processing (NLP), as there has been very little NLP research in Bengali, though it is one of the most extensively spoken languages of the world. Therefore, I did my undergraduate thesis on '<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sujitdebnath/sujitdebnath.github.io/master/src/resources/senior_year_thesis.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Kothamala - A Bangla Speech Recognition Engine</a>,' where we conducted this research-based project in two divisions; one was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBSLP.2018.8554395" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Bengali Short Speech Commands Recognition</a>, and the other one was Bengali Transcription.</p>
                        <p>Besides my undergraduate studies, I was involved with several organizations, including <a href="http://nsuproblemsolvers.com" target="_blank" style="color: black;">NSU Problem Solvers (NSUPS)</a>, <a href="https://jaago.com.bd" target="_blank" style="color: black;">JAAGO Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://vbd.com.bd" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Volunteer for Bangladesh (VBD)</a>. I started working as a volunteer at VBD, Dhaka division in 2014, which is a non-political volunteer and youth wing of JAAGO. However, involvement with several organizations and working as a volunteer in several social communities significantly polished my interpersonal and social skills.</p>
                        <p>Personally, I am a slightly introvert who loves to read books of different genres, e.g., thriller, mystery, fantasy, science fiction, classic, etc. Moreover, I invariably try to be contented and to evolve myself every day for the upcoming days with new challenges. Because I always remember the following quote by George Bernard Shaw,</p>
                        <q>Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.</q>

                                        <p>Despite being one of the most extensively spoken languages in the world, the Bengali language has inadequate resources. Due to the lack of adequate and suitable public datasets in Bengali, it is difficult to work with the Bengali Language. In this study, Bengali short speech commands data set has been reported that consists of 10 frequently used short speech commands, each with approximately 100 utterances. Later, three different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures have been proposed to recognize those short speech commands. One of the models took raw audio as input, whereas another model took Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of the audio signals as inputs, and the third model leveraged transfer learning by pre-training the model with English short speech commands. Experimental results reveal that the MFCC model shows better accuracy in recognizing Bengali short speech commands where, surprisingly, the model predicting on raw audio data is very competitive. Though the models have shown proficiency in identifying single-syllable words but encounter difficulties in recognizing multi-syllable commands.</p>

                                        <p>Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, leading to irreversible vision loss. Hence detecting Glaucoma at an early stage is very crucial for preventing blindness. But, Glaucoma detection often requires an advanced diagnosis that is not accessible to most hospitals in a developing country like Bangladesh. Therefore, the detection of Glaucoma with the help of common and fewer tests would certainly improve Glaucoma patients' condition. In this research, a method is devised using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to detect Glaucoma with the data obtained from two ophthalmological tests, which are Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Tonometry along with some other risk factors. Furthermore, the data of two ophthalmological tests are collected from <a href="https://www.vcf-bd.org" target="_blank" style="color: black; font-style: italic;">Bashundhara Eye Hospital & Research Institute</a>.</p>

                                        <p>The Bengali language is one of the most extensively used spoken languages around the world. Nevertheless, the resources in Bengali are inadequate since there is a lack of proper public datasets that can be used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). As a result, no significant NLP research has been conducted in Bengali. Therefore, as the Capstone Project, we conducted a research-based project related to the Bengali language in two divisions; one was Bengali Short Speech Commands Recognition, and the other one was Bengali Transcription.</br>
                                        <b>Bengali Short Speech Commands Recognition:</b> In this division, we developed a dataset of popular Bengali short speech commands consisting of 50 frequently used short speech commands. Each command has approximately 200 utterances, which is why it is first of its kind in the context of Bengali datasets. However, each utterance duration is less than 2 seconds, and all the samples were taken in noisy real-life conditions. Later, several experiments had been conducted to recognize ten Bengali short speech commands, and three different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures had been proposed. One of the models took raw audio as input, whereas another model took Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of the audio signals as inputs, and the third model leveraged transfer learning by pre-training the model with English short speech commands. Though the model trained with MFCCs performed better, but all the models performed relatively well.</br>
                                        <b>Bengali Transcription:</b> The data set used in this division is an open-source dataset taken from <a href="http://openslr.org/53" target="_blank" style="color: black; font-style: italic;">OpenSLR</a>, released by Google. It contains 2,18,703 utterances of Bengali speech with their corresponding labels in a CSV file. In this section, combined with a language model, we had developed a Bengali speech to text engine. However, the spectrogram had been incorporated as an audio pre-processing strategy along with MFCCs and raw audios. Later, three different model architectures had been experimented for building speech to text engine. As the audios are sequential inputs, one model had been designed with time distributed dense neural network architecture; another model with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture combined with convolutional layers to extract features from audios. Additionally, we had trained another minimal model in combination with one convolutional and one time distributed layer. A special kind of loss function, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), which can deal with the variable length of sequences, had been applied as a loss function in all these models. However, given a sequence of audio signals, assuming the audio will be Bengali phonemes; the network will predict a sequence of Bengali characters' probability distribution. However, it was unfortunate that our transcription system was not able to transcript speech into text efficiently.</p>

                                        <p>Stroke is a life-threatening medical condition that is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Moreover, prediction and diagnoses of stroke are intricate tasks; require several diagnostic tests costing valuable time and expertise of medical practitioners. A computer-aided system can help doctors minimize the complexity of predicting and diagnosing stroke and take necessary steps by which stroke can be avoided. In this research-based project, several Machine Learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, etc along with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) had been used to predict the risk of stroke on 16 different features excluding the class. However, the dataset was initially collected by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57261-1_26" target="_blank" style="color: black; font-style: italic;">Farzana et al.</a> from <a href="http://www.dmc.gov.bd" target="_blank" style="color: black; font-style: italic;">Dhaka Medical College</a> for their research work, which consists of 500 patients' data; among them, 350 patients are diagnosed with a stroke, and 150 are diagnosed as normal or non-stroke. Data were collected from patients' case history, pathological tests, and Lipid profile test. After using the SMOTE to balance the dataset, several classifiers performed notably well, outperforming the other work on the same dataset.</p>
